# Weather_Prediction_Analysis
This repository contains a machine learning project for weather prediction using a dataset with temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and pressure. It includes data preprocessing, model training, accuracy evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy score, and prediction testing.
This project explores:
✔ Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, feature scaling)
✔ Model Selection (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
✔ Performance Metrics (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Score, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
✔ Visualizations (Heatmaps, Plots, Model Comparisons)

By using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib, we build a robust predictive model that can assist in decision-making for weather-dependent activities.

Features:
Temperature (float)
Humidity (float)
Wind Speed (float)
Cloud Cover (float)
Pressure (float)
Rain (int, target variable: 0 or 1)

Usage
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Train a machine learning model
3. Evaluate model performance
4. Make predictions

Model Evaluation :
Confusion Matrix
Accuracy Score
Precision & recall
F1-score

The trained model provides reliable weather predictions based on historical data. The performance of different machine learning algorithms is compared using confusion matrices and evaluation metrics.The trained machine learning model achieved an accuracy score of 86.8% (0.868) on the test dataset. This indicates that the model correctly predicts weather conditions in 86.8% of cases.
